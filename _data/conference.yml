  High-dimensional vector data management is a fundamental problem in many applications, such as image search, information retrieval, recommendation, social network analysis, and so forth. It has been extensively studied over decades and consists of many topics. Among them the high-dimensional vector similarity search is the most signi cant one, because it serves as the basic functionality in this eld. A commonly adopted setting for high-dimensional vector similarity search is to retrieve the k nearest neighbors (kNN). Over hundreds of algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem from di erent perspectives. How to retrieve a good approximation (high recall) of true kNN with acceptable overhead (low time and space complexity) becomes the most concerned question.With the development of e ective and e cient similarity search methods, topics on top of it become prevalent, such as applying it in distributed or parallel environment. 
  This workshop aims at providing a place for researchers from the elds of database and data engineering to exchange ideas about how to adapt and develop techniques to process, analyze and manage high-dimensional vector data.
